MOVON tackles a very basic idea: sports bookings. Here, at the University of Bath, students have to either phone the Sport Center or physically go there to book tennis courts or football pitches. This is both time consuming for the students and the university's staff as well, on top of being widely inconvenient for anyone looking to casually play any kind of sports.

This is where MOVON comes in: an online system for booking courts for any sport you want, any time you want, on any court you want. After logging in, users can select their sports and are then offered a selection of available time slots for their them to exercise. Once a suitable time slot is found, the user can book that time slot and receives an email of confirmation to make sure he remembers the booking.

The objective of MOVON is simple: make everyone's life on campus easier.
